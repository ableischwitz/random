Hello there...

This is my personal GitHub repository for some random scripts and other files.
Feel free to explore, copy, rewrite and use them to your hearts desire.

Some scripts were written by me, some from friends at Red Hat when they were
onsite for some consulting gigs.

If you have any questions go and drop me a mail.

Stef
